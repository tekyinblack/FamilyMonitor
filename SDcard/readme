This folder contains example files to include on the setup SDcard for the Family Monitor
These are the config file, the approriate wifi credentials, email account credentials,
the four email files and the status file. An example log file is also included but as
this is created by the unit anyway then it doesn't have to be added to the SDcard manually.
